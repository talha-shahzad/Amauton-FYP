START
    Load image datasets from sources
    Preprocess images (resize, normalize)
    Extract features using deep learning model (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
    Calculate cosine similarity between image feature vectors
    IF similarity below threshold THEN
        Use SSIM for comparison
    END IF
    IF similarity score above threshold THEN
        Mark images as matching
    ELSE
        Mark images as non-matching
    END IF
    RETURN matched and non-matched products with similarity scores
END
